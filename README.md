# Project Idea

A Digital habitat platform that will enable teachers to reach a wide audience, to request supplies for kids to succeed in school. Habitat will connect two different communities together. 

# Project background/Business Opportunity

## Why:

In some schools, especially younger kids, face many challenges while studying. Since classrooms have a diversity of culture and economic students, going to school is not equal for everyone. Depending on the situations and time management, kids come to school on an empty stomach. This definitely affects the kids health and the ability to stay focused in sharing knowledge. Additionally, some students do not have the required tools such as school supplies, such as notebooks, pens etc. Many students are not able to participate in activities which will require some amount of participation with purchase. Schools plan many activities where kids can be involved in and improve their physical and mental states. However, this does not correlate with all the students because many do not have the same level of economic stability as their parents cannot afford such things. These things could affect kids massively in their future life academically and professionally. 

## Opportunity: 

Currently there are not a whole lot of tools available to solve these problems. Most used way right now is word-to-mouth scenarios where school teachers connect with people in their circle for helping hands. This tool does not yield a high success rate as many times people tend to forget to communicate. This also has a very small audience and depends on the teacherâ€™s group circle.

This is an opportunity to help the community to solve their problem via technology. Digital habits can help to connect two different communities together. Such a platform will enable teachers to reach a wide audience, in which people with extra supplies can give away to help kids.
